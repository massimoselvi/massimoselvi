I’m a passionate IT engineer specializing in cloud architectures, with extensive expertise in designing and implementing AWS cloud solutions.
My 20+ years in full-stack development are complemented by significant experience in serverless architecture, Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), microservices, and modular monoliths. I bring 12 years of experience with the Laravel PHP framework, 8 years with NodeJS/TypeScript, and 6 years configuring and managing cloud multi-account/multi-environment infrastructures.
As a Software Developer with strong TDD practice, I'm deeply aware of the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and committed to enhancing Developer Experience (DX) at every level.
I've primarily focused on R&D, cloud infrastructure design, distributed software design, automated tests and deployments, alongside regular code development using modern programming languages such as TypeScript, Go and PHP.
I’ve designed migration solutions from legacy codebases and monolithic architectures to modern AWS serverless architectures. Infrastructure-as-Code (CloudFormation and CDK) and automation are at the core.
My development practices encompass OOP, MVC, Design Patterns, DDD, ORM, Migrations, Unit Tests, Queues, CLI, and REPL.
Through self-education and a non-conventional career path, I have cultivated a unique approach to problem-solving. When conventional technology literature proves inadequate, I embrace an unconventional mindset, actively seeking innovative solutions and embracing novel challenges.
I'm a team player, active listener, eager to learn, and happy to share knowledge, always supportive of others. I adopt and promote Agile methodologies, SCRUM ceremonies, and XP practices such as pair programming and mob programming.
I adhere daily to principles like LESS IS MORE, K.I.S.S., SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, Clean Code, and 12-Factor App, applying them even in small areas.
Day-to-day work tools: GIT (with GIT-FLOW branching or TRUNK-based development), Docker, VSCode, Xcode, and Vim.
Born and raised in Forlì, Italy, I currently reside in Ravenna. As a devoted father of two beautiful daughters, I am fortunate to have them living independently. While I am currently employed in a fulfilling position, I approach the future with optimism and a keen interest in new opportunities.
No individual is flawless, including myself. My primary objective is to maintain focus on my objectives and cultivate the requisite composure to attain them, even in the face of demanding deadlines.
